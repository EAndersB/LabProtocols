LabProtocols
============

The Environmental Genomic Group also does lab work. This is how we do it.

The Amplicon_dual_index_prep ia a protocol for preparing amplicon libraries for Illumina sequencing, with up to 400 unique barcodes, but this is easily extendable to other sequences.

For specific primer sequences, check the Primer_sequences file.

CA_cleaning is how we clean our PCR products. It is automated in a Magnetic Bead Station, and cannot be used otherwise.
