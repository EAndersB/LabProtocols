LabProtocols
============

The Environmental Genomic Group also does lab work. This is how we do it.

The Amplicon_single_index_prep and Amplicon_dual_index_prep are protocols for preparing amplicon libraries for Illumina sequencing. The only difference between them is that the Single only takes up to 48 samples, the dual up to 96. Talk to us if you need even more multiplexing!

For specific primer sequences, check the Primer_sequences file.

CA_cleaning is how we clean our PCR products. It is automatized in a Magnetic Bead Station, and cannot be used otherwise.
