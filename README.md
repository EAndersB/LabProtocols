LabProtocols
============

The Environmental Genomic Group also does lab work. This is how we do it.

The Amplicon_dual_index_prep_EnvGen.rst is a protocol for preparing amplicon libraries for Illumina sequencing, with up to 1152 unique barcodes combinations (The_32_36_indexes_sequences_EnvGen.rst). 

For specific 16S and 18S primer sequences, check Primer_sequences.rst, their targeted phylums were presented in a table (The_16S_18S_primers_targeted_phylums.rst). 

All protocol related files in their original format are also offered in links.
